* add an abstract 'Initialize' function to IOAESource
* implement an audio object that generates it's own audio data, subclassed from audio object
	- build a sine wave generator
* build a DFT for processing audio signals
* improve DFT by implementing an FFT
* build a c# interface to the audio engine
