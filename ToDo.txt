* OAEAudioObject
	- maintains an active vector of COAESoundInstances
	- COAESoundInstance:
		derives from IXAudio2VoiceCallback
		has audio source id
		maintains XAUDIO2_BUFFER instances
		uses file to populate data buffers

* implement an audio object that generates it's own audio data, subclassed from audio object
	- build a sine wave generator
* implement ability to stream audio
* build a DFT for processing audio signals
* improve DFT by implementing an FFT
* build a c# interface to the audio engine
