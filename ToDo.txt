* implement an audio object that generates it's own audio data, subclassed from audio object
	- build a sine wave generator
* implement ability to stream audio
* make the application loop while the audio engine is active
* implement file manager
* rename audio object to audio emitter, or create a that derives from audio object
* work out how to handle different wav formats
	- handle different wav formats with different voices in the same audio object?
* build a DFT for processing audio signals
* improve DFT by implementing an FFT
* build a c# interface to the audio engine
